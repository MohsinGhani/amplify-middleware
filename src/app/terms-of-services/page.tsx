              our users to do the same. NoireTV, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Section
              512 as amended by Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
              (the &#8220;Act&#8221;), reserves the right, but not the
              obligation, to terminate your license to use the online services
              if it determines in its sole and absolute discretion that you are
              involved in infringing activity, including alleged acts of
              first-time or repeat infringement, regardless of whether the
              material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.
              NoireTV accommodates and does not interfere with standard
              technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their

              property; please send a written notice to the agent identified
              below to request a review of the alleged infringement:

              in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute,
              NoireTV agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to
              you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable
              arbitration provisions set forth in this Paragraph 8, provided,
              however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or
              restrict the application of subpart 8(B)(iv); and 8F. Furthermore,
              this Paragraph 8 shall not prevent any party from seeking
              provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of
              appropriate jurisdiction.

              <strong>(ii) Written Award</strong>. The Arbitrator shall issue a
              written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth
              the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and the
              factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an
              “Award”). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court
              having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the
              relevant party or its assets Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration
              Act.

              <strong>(iii) Location of Arbitration.</strong> The Arbitration
              shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if
              applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that
              such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not
              require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of
              business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually
              agreed upon by you and NoireTV; or (iii) at your election, if the
              only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for
              less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written
              submission.

              . With the exception of subpart 8(F) below, if any part of this
              arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or
              illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then
              the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect
              and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the
              invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not
              contained herein. If, however, subpart 8(F) is found to be
              invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this
              arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor
              NoireTV shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must
              instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.

              OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH

              information on the Site and Service, NoireTV makes no warranties
              or representations as to its accuracy, timeliness, reliability,

              NOIRETV PROVIDES THE SITE AND SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS
              AVAILABLE” BASIS. NOIRETV, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS
              (COLLECTIVELY, THE “NoireTV PARTIES”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND
              CONDITIONS, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
              THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
              FOREGOING, NoireTV DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE OR OTHER SERVICE
              WILL (1) BE UNINTERRUPTED; (2) BE FREE FROM INACCURACIES, ERRORS,
              VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; (3) MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS;
              OR (4) OPERATE IN THE CONFIGURATION OR WITH THE HARDWARE OR
              SOFTWARE YOU USE. YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND SERVICES IS SOLELY AT
              YOUR RISK.
              <br />
              Some jurisdictions limit or do not allow the disclaimer of implied
              or other warranties so the above disclaimers may not apply to the
              extent such jurisdictions’ laws are applicable.

            <Typography>### LIMITATIONS OF OUR LIABILITY</Typography>
            <Typography>
              IN NO EVENT WILL THE NOIRETV PARTIES&#8217; AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
              YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE AND SERVICE OR THESE TERMS EXCEED
              (A) THE AMOUNT (IF ANY) PAID BY YOU TO NoireTV IN THE SIX MONTHS
              IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY;
              OR (B) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS LESS.
              <br />
              BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE EXCLUSION OF
              DAMAGES, NOIRETV’S LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE
              LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH
              JURISDICTION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
              PERMIT THE DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, THE DISCLAIMERS SET
              FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS PROVISION WILL ONLY APPLY
              IF AN ARBITRATOR WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS EXCLUSIONS OF
              DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE.

              RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.
              THIS LIMITATION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON
              CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
              THEORY, AND EVEN IF NOIRETV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
              SUCH DAMAGE. THIS WAIVER APPLIES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO ANY
              DAMAGES OR INJURY ARISING FROM ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR,
              OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR

              LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NOIRETV WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR

              AS OUR SERVICE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE
              OFFER THE SERVICE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE
              OFFERING THE SERVICE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH
              THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN
              TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW

              ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE
              CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR
              YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. In the event any notice to you of
              new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be
              insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient
              notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently
              check the Site, and the e-mail you provided to us for notices, all
              of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice.
              You can reject any new, revised or additional Terms by
              discontinuing use of the Service and related services.
